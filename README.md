# Tesco_Operational_Workflow


Concept: 
If 10 people were to complete 10 tasks. everyone does everything and works less efficiently. If 10 persons focus on their own dedicated tasks and isnt required to switch tasks as often. The overall productivity of the team increases through delegation of work. 

Task: 
Map out process flow of the whole day and tasks to be completed. 
At the moment it just seems like everyone sees a task to be done, and does it in a reactive manner. If someone can see the full scope of what needs to be completed, then we can further delegate tasks.
